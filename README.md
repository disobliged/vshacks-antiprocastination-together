# vshacks-antiprocastination

Welcome to our terminal app  to stop procastination.

## Why Did We Make This?

We made this app so that we can help students better organize their time. As students
ourselves, we also struggle with procrastination and we want to help not only us, but
others who also face this problem on a regular basis

## How Does it Work?

We made a text-based applet to help calculate how much time is needed to do schoolwork.
We got these estimates through averaging how long we take to work and it might vary between students.
We then prompt students to enter how much school work they have into the app and the app
will calculate (based on our averages) how long students need to do work. Then our app
will print out estimated time on how long they need to work for.

## Is This a Finished Product?

No! We plan to also add a functionality on adding a to-do list, a timer, and a better version of our homework time calculator.

## How to Download

You can clone the repository or you can just download the file itself. The SHA256 sum of the main.py file is ```769cbbabdab7fd7375a6ba16804bf8b63b5f19c7859bd943c9c80a5498fd9956```.
This is an optional step but it can help verify integrity of the file.

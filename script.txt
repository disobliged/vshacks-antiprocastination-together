J Hello, welcome to anti-procrastinate together's homework time calculator!
K As students, we struggle with procrastination and we want to help not only us, but others who also face this problem on a regular basis.
J To fix this, we made a calculator to help calculate how long we need to study
K We also wanted to make it clean and simple and we chose to make a text-based terminal app.

*show code demo*
K we found the average time to do our work to be as follows

1.5 hrs for homework
1 hrs for quiz review
1.5 hrs for test review
3 hrs for exam review
and 2 hrs for project work

J To stop distractions, our terminal is clean and simple.

*demo the code*
Note-do whatever combination you want, honestly we just need to make sure the math adds up
K Lets say we have [insert combination of work, for example: _ pieces of homework and _ tests]
K now lets put it into the calculator [narrate as you type]
*check the math adds up and repeat the step above at least 2 more times.

*Stay on the page or show the logo again, doesnt matter tbh*
J This is only the start of our project, we will continue to work on this after the hackathon ends.
K We learned a lot from this project, mainly how to manage our time and cut items that are uneccessary
J We initially wanted to make a homework list and a timer for work, however we did not go around to doing that, so we only used our time prediction module.
K Despite these losses, we learned how to do better next time and we also helped solve the issue on how might we improve students' lives.
J We hope you enjoyed and thanks for watching
